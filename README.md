Description:
QRecipes is a mobile app that allows foodies to be able to 
cook their favorite dishes at home without going to a restaurant 
to eat in. Our application solve this by providing them access to 
hundreds of recipes with a single scan to the QR codes.

How it looks like:
We essentially built four tabs for this mobile app aside from the authentication screens. 
The first tab is the home tab where it displays a collection view of pictures for different dishes. 
Users will be able to like and comment from this page. 
The second tab is the search tab where it allows users to search for restaurants, 
dishes based on name, tags, and popularity. Users will be able to see a list of 
images of dished based on the search words. 
The third tab we have is the favorites tab. 
This is the page that displays all the dishes that users has favorited. 
The last tab is the settings tab and it will show all the corresponding user information such as username, 
the recipes user has purchased, terms of use, and so on. Aside from this tab, we have a pop up window for QR scanning 
to allow users to scan QR code to access to recipes under the same restaurant in a quick and easy way.
